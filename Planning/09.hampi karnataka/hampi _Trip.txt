Bro this is already a solid plan 🔥
I’ll refine it for MONSOON + PHOTOGRAPHY + NATURE BEAUTY, adjust Day-wise flow, and give you the EXACT BEST MONTH + TIME so you get green landscapes, clouds, water, but NOT risky rain.

I won’t disturb your core structure — only upgrade it 👌

🌧️ BEST MONSOON TIME FOR HAMPI (VERY IMPORTANT)
🏆 BEST MONTHS (MONSOON + SAFE + GREEN)

✅ LATE AUGUST – SEPTEMBER (BEST)
⭐ Early OCTOBER (PERFECT)

❌ Avoid:

Mid–August → Unpredictable heavy showers

🌿 Why Late Aug–Sept is GOLD:

Landscape turns lush green

Tungabhadra river has water

Sanapur Lake looks magical

Water channels & small waterfalls appear

Clouds + golden light = insane photography

Rain is short & controlled, not continuous

📸 Photographer’s season = Sept first 2 weeks

⏰ DAILY TIMING RULE (FOR MONSOON)

This matters more than itinerary.

5:45 – 9:30 AM	Photography + temples + hills
