Become a strong individual contributor

4️⃣ Why DevOps Was Chosen

Strong connection with:

Linux

Automation

Cloud

Real-world systems

Fits System Engineer background

High demand + future-proof

Does NOT require heavy DSA like pure SDE roles

Better growth for non-CS background if skills are strong

5️⃣ Honest Reality About DevOps

DevOps is not easy

Requires:

Consistency

Hands-on practice

Real projects

BUT:

Degree does not block DevOps jobs

Experience + skills matter more

Market rewards practical engineers

6️⃣ Learning Strategy Decided
Step-by-step approach (NO rushing):

Foundations first

Linux

Bash scripting

Git

Networking basics

Then DevOps tools

Docker

CI/CD

Cloud (AWS)

Terraform

Kubernetes

Projects-driven learning

Every topic → mini project

One BIG end-to-end project

7️⃣ Main Project (Portfolio Project)
Project Idea:

Personal Finance Tracker

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Vite)

Backend:

Python (Flask) → primary

Go (optional microservice later)

Database:

PostgreSQL (main)

MongoDB (optional for logs)

DevOps:

Docker

Docker Compose

CI/CD (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)

AWS

Terraform

Kubernetes

Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

Purpose:

Covers UI + Backend + DB + DevOps

Real-world use case

Resume-ready project

8️⃣ Programming Languages Strategy
For DevOps & Interviews:

Must-have

Bash (mandatory)

Python (automation)

Good to have

Go (DevOps tooling, performance)

Background advantage

C / C++

Node.js

Java

👉 DSA can be done in C++ or Python
(No need to be advanced like FAANG-level)

9️⃣ DevOps Learning Timeline (Realistic)

Interview-ready DevOps:
👉 100 days (basic–intermediate)

Strong DevOps profile:
👉 6–9 months

Switch-ready for ₹10–12 LPA:
👉 18–24 months total experience

🔟 100-Day DevOps Challenge (Summary)
Phase-wise:

Linux + Bash + Git

Docker + CI/CD

AWS + Terraform

Kubernetes + Final Project

Outcome:

2–3 real projects

Resume-ready skills

Interview confidence

1️⃣1️⃣ LinkedIn Strategy

Post once a week (Monday)

Topic-based + mini project-based posts

No exaggeration

Learning-in-public approach

Weekly Post Format:

What I learned

What I practiced/built

Key realization

1️⃣2️⃣ Weekly Mini-Project Approach

Examples:

Disk monitoring script

Backup automation

Cron job scheduler

System health check script

Later combined into:

Linux System Automation Toolkit

1️⃣3️⃣ Salary Reality (India – Honest)

After 1 year:

₹6–8 LPA (if skills + projects)

After 2–2.5 years:

₹8–12 LPA (realistic)

₹12–15+ LPA:

Requires strong projects, English, confidence, consistency

Base salary today does NOT decide future salary
Skills + proof decide.

1️⃣4️⃣ English Improvement Plan

Daily:

Read 10–15 minutes

Speak loudly (self)

Weekly:

Write LinkedIn post

Explain what you learned in simple English

Goal:

Clear, confident communication (not perfect English)

1️⃣5️⃣ Current Focus (NOW)

Bash scripting (advance)

Linux internals

Small scripts + practice

Weekly LinkedIn post

Consistency > speed

✅ FINAL TRUTH (MOST IMPORTANT)

You are not late

You are not weak

You are not wasting time

DevOps is a correct and safe choice for you

Consistency for 18–24 months = life-changing results
